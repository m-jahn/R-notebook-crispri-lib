# R-notebooks

### Introduction | Disclaimer

R markdown notebooks to document my computational biology projects.
This repository contains data processing pipelines or data curation projects
that require a higher level of maintenance and documentation. 

In contrast to some of my other github projects, 
like [SysbioTreemaps](https:/github.com/m-jahn/SysbioTreemaps),
[ShinyMC](https:/github.com/m-jahn/ShinyMC), [ShinyProt](https:/github.com/m-jahn/ShinyProt),
or [ShinyLib](https:/github.com/m-jahn/ShinyLib),
the pipelines in this repository are not necessarily in the form of R packages or apps.
This means the pipelines were created for a particular purpose or data analysis task,
but are not further developed or maintained.

The pipelines and their documentation collected here therefore come with no warranty
regarding stability or executability in future R versions. However, all care was taken to
guarantee scientific accuracy and adhere to good scientific practice in terms of statistics,
reproducibility and code documentation. Please report any errors by filing a github issue.

The documentation of the code is part of the actual pipeline. The pipelines themselves can
be downloaded and executed from the `pipeline` sub-folders. To inspect the code chunks 
and their corresponding results follow the links below (`*.html` reports).
