# R-notebooks

R markdown notebooks to document everyday computational biology projects.
This repository contains data processing pipelines or data curation projects
with a little higher requirement of maintenance and documentation. 

In contrast to some of my other github projects, 
like [SysbioTreemaps](https:/github.com/m-jahn/SysbioTreemaps),
[ShinyMC](https:/github.com/m-jahn/ShinyMC) or [ShinyProt](https:/github.com/m-jahn/ShinyProt),
the pipelines in this repo are explicitly not meant to be useful, comprehensible or applicable
for other users than me.

The code and documentation collected here can be of temporary nature and might
change quickly. The notebooks can also merely serve as quick tests and therefore 
come with absolutely no warranty regarding scientific or technical reliability.
